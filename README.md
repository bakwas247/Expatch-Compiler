TopazTK and group are working on a implementation of this so this is purely for my own enjoyment.

Compiler that takes input script and outputs a pnach compatible with PCSX2-EX to make modding easier.
Please refer to the wiki for accepted functions.

Features:

➜Variable Storage

➜Easier to remember syntax

➜Better visualised if loops

Limitations (To-Fix):

➜Can only handle 2 if loops, 2 ifaddr loops and 1 timer loop at once.
